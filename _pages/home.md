# Current

I am a PhD student in Environmental Science and Engineering at Caltech, working with Tapio Schneider, Andrew Stuart and Joern Callies. I am primarily interested in stochastic models for the climate, and robust state estimation techniques for deep ocean temperatures.

# Past

Previously, I worked with Inga Berre at Universitetet i Bergen on modeling of subsurface geothermal flows. There, I also completed a BS.c. in 2019 and MS.c. in 2020 in applied mathematics.
